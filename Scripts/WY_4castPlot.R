{
  # The following code creates a plot of "hind casts" from the 24 Month Study
  # for the accumulated unregulated inflow volume (AUIV) at the end of a water 
  # year for a given reservoir.The format for these plots is derived from
  # Figure 5 of White Paper #7 from the CCRS 
  # (https://qcnr.usu.edu/coloradoriver/files/news/White-Paper-7.pdf).
  
  # Inputs:
  #   data: the file path/data file that contains the 24 months of 24-MS data
  #         for projecting the AUIV at the end of the water year of interest.
  #   yr: the year of interest for the projections
  #   resname: the reservoir name of interest
  #   auiv: the actual value for the AUIV at the end of the WY of interest
  
  # Outputs: Plot of the "hind casts"
